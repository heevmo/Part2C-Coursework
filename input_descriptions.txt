Descriptions of input files:

correct_input.txt - 

The correct input file includes the same contact person added multiple times, to show that it is only added once, the container is updated. 

We also have the same contact person added with different information (sometimes with telephone, sometimes with email, sometimes with both) to show how it updates in the container. 

The input file also includes a contact that has the same surname and name to show that when it searches for the name/surname, the contact only prints once. 

We also test to check that the contacts are printed in alphabetical order regardless of the order they’re written in the input file (e.g. Mary, Marian, Maria). 


incorrect_input1.txt - 

Checks to see that the code stops reading the input file once it reaches a string that doesn’t begin with angular brackets (<>).


incorrect_input2.txt - 

Checks to see that the code stops reading the input file when it encounters nested angular brackets.


incorrect_input3.txt - 

Checks to see that the code stops reading the input file when it encounters a vector with less/more information than expected.


incorrect_input4.txt - 

Checks to see that the code stops reading the input file when the order of the input is <person N [name] S [surname]> instead of <person S [surname] N [name]>.


incorrect_input5.txt - 

Checks to see that the code stops reading the input file when the vector doesn’t start with the word “person”.
